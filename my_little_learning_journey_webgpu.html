        My Little Learning Journey: WebGPU
      </h1>
      <p>Written by <em>Sif Høg-Getgood</em>, 10/07/2024</p>
      <p>
        I have been working on making a little game – a 2D tank interpretation
        of World of Tanks – and most recently, I’ve been working on a desktop
        app, where you can design levels in a CAD environment. It’s a great
        learning experience! It&#39;s no secret that I want to build a game
        engine, and all the knowledge I gain while developing this level design
        app, I call her
        <a
          href="https://github.com/sifhg/tanks_lite/tree/main/battleground-builder"
          >Battleground Builder</a
        >, will be invaluable for that.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the core functionality is to add instances of assets to a stage, move
        them, rotate them, and scale them. Each asset has paths of vectors
        describing its position and shape. Some assets have more vectors than
        others, and every time the user performs an action (move, rotate, or
        move), the CPU recalculates every element of every vector in every path
        in every asset. I didn’t like the idea of the user tormenting their CPU
        performing so many calculations if they create a level with a lot of
        assets. So, I decided to learn how to utilize the GPU to perform those
        calculations: more specifically WebGPU, WebGL’s successor, so modern
        that a lot of browsers still don’t support it. The lack of support could
        be an issue but Battleground Builder is a Electron app, which means it
        installs an instance of Chromium which happens to support it so all is
        good.

      <h2 id="google-your-first-webgpu-app">Google: Your first WebGPU app</h2>
      <p>
        So I went to
        <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/your-first-webgpu-app#0"
          >Google’s codelab course for learning WebGPU.</a
        >
        This course seemed promising in the beginning; the only requirement was
        knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and Chrome DevTool, not to forget a
        browser that supports WebGPU. That sounded like no issue so I was on
        board. I followed it closely but the further I dived into the course the
        more terms were introduced that I just struggled to make sense of. I’ve
        never done GPU computing before, so there were so many concepts I wasn’t
        aware of, and even if I tried to reread the parts about those concepts,
        I couldn’t comprehend it. I did manage to draw some graphics though, but
        I couldn’t make sense of most of the code. If your browser supports it,
        have a look at these pretty colours and shapes:<br />[What I managed to
        create using]
      </p>
      <p>
        I gave up on this when I got to chapter 5. Though I couldn’t grasp all
        the content of this though, I did get a sense of how GPU computations
        work. I figured that the computations themselves were carried out by
        programs called shaders that can calculate positions on the screen
        (vertex shaders) and colours of each pixel (fragment shaders), and do it
        all in parallel.

        I moved on trying a new resource that was
        <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn3eTxaOtL2Ns3wkxdyS3CiqkJuwQdZzn"
          >a youtube video series called WebGPU for Beginners</a
        >. Good resource, but it would also show it was not quite what I was
        looking for; I’m quite amazed by this YouTuber, being able to release
        learning resources so quickly after the technology came out. The videos
        on this channel,
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GetIntoGameDev">GetIntoGameDev</a>,
        gave me the impression that Andres, who’s behind the channel, has a deep
        passion for graphics programming, and for teaching it. If you are
        interested in next gen graphic libraries such as DirectX 12, Vulkan, and
        Metal, I’d highly encourage you to check out the channel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Andrew took good time explaining the fundamental principles, and I felt
        like I managed to grasp concepts like pipeline, renderer, and the
        language WGSL better from these videos.
      </p>
      <p>Before I stopped, I managed to make this colourful triangle.</p>
      <p>[]</p>
      <p>
        Why did I stop here? For two reason. 1) These videos were for beginners,
        and even though I’m a beginner, they were for a different kind of
        beginners. These videos were for people that already had experience in
        GPU programming, but not so much in JS and Node.JS. I was the other way
        I around: I had plenty of experience in JS making user interfaces, but I
        had never worked with anything that resembled a GPU library. And 2) I
        realized I was specifically learning graphics. What I wanted to do was
        performing matrix computations in parallel. I imagine that most people
        looking into GPU libraries do it to do, well, graphic processing, and
        for such a young library as WebGPU, I don’t know if I can really expect
        many reasoureces to be out for the learning WebGPU for the purpose of
        non-graphic computations.
      </p>
      <h1 id="webgpu-fundamentals">WebGPU Fundamentals</h1>
      <p>
        So looking for something specifically teaching WebGPU for parallel
        computations, I found
        <a
          href="https://webgpufundamentals.org/webgpu/lessons/webgpu-fundamentals.html"
          >this is a website dedicated to teaching WebGPU</a
        >, written by <a href="https://github.com/greggman">Gregg Tavares</a>. I
        started from the beginning beginning, trying to solidify my undersanding
        of the fundamentals again, skipped the part about graphics (vertex and
        fragment shaders) and jumped directly to
        <a
          href="https://webgpufundamentals.org/webgpu/lessons/webgpu-fundamentals.html#a-run-computations-on-the-gpu"
          >the precious compute shaders</a
        >. I’ve only worked with this today, but I feel pretty certain I’ve
        finally found the resource teaching me what I want to learn.
      </p>
      <p>See this!</p>

        I know it looks less impressive. I could quikly have made this vector
        scalar with a simple script, but this is using the GPU and it calculates
        everything i parallel; I'm proud of this, and I’m looking forward to get
        a better hang of compute shaders, so I can use them for big matrix
        calculations in Battleground Builder.
