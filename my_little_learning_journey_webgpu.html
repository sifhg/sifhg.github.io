        My Little Learning Journey: WebGPU
      </h1>
      <p>Written by <em>Sif Høg-Getgood</em>, 10/07/2024</p>
      <p>
        I have been working on making a little game – a 2D tank interpretation
        of World of Tanks – and most recently, I’ve been working on a desktop
        app, where you can design levels in a CAD environment. It’s a great
        learning experience! It&#39;s no secret that I want to build a game
        engine, and all the knowledge I gain while developing this level design
        app, I call her
        <a
          href="https://github.com/sifhg/tanks_lite/tree/main/battleground-builder"
          >Battleground Builder</a
        >, will be invaluable for that.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the core functionality is to add instances of assets to a stage, move
        them, rotate them, and scale them. Each asset has paths of vectors
        describing its position and shape. Some assets have more vectors than
        others, and every time the user performs an action (move, rotate, or
        move), the CPU recalculates every element of every vector in every path
        in every asset. I didn’t like the idea of the user tormenting their CPU
        performing so many calculations if they create a level with a lot of
        assets. So, I decided to learn how to utilize the GPU to perform those
        calculations: more specifically WebGPU, WebGL’s successor, so modern
        that a lot of browsers still don’t support it. The lack of support could
        be an issue but Battleground Builder is a Electron app, which means it
        installs an instance of Chromium which happens to support it so all is
        good.

      <h2 id="google-your-first-webgpu-app">Google: Your first WebGPU app</h2>
      <p>
        So I went to
        <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/your-first-webgpu-app#0"
          >Google’s codelab course for learning WebGPU.</a
        >
        This course seemed promising in the beginning; the only requirement was
        knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and Chrome DevTool, not to forget a
        browser that supports WebGPU. That didn't sound like an issue, so I was
        on board. I followed it closely but the further I dived into the course,
        the more terms were introduced that I just struggled to make sense of.
        I’ve never done GPU computing before, so there were quite a few concepts
        I wasn’t aware of; and even when I reread the parts about those
        concepts, the course didn't manage to introduce them in a language that
        made sense to someone new to the topic. I did manage to draw some
        graphics though, but I couldn’t make sense of most of the code. If your
        browser supports it, have a look at square with a deep red colour:<br />

      <script src="codelab_progress.js"></script>
      <p>
        I gave up on this when I got to chapter 5. Though I didn't grasp all the
        content of this, I did get a sense of how GPU computations work. I
        figured that the computations themselves were carried out by programs
        called <i>shaders</i> that can calculate positions on the screen (vertex
        shaders) and colours of each pixel (fragment shaders), and do it all in
        parallel.

      <p>
        I moved on trying a new resource that was
        <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn3eTxaOtL2Ns3wkxdyS3CiqkJuwQdZzn"
          >a YouTube video series called WebGPU for Beginners</a
        >. While I’m quite amazed by this YouTuber, being able to release
        learning resources so quickly after the technology was released, this
        series, however, would show that it was not quite what I was looking
        for. The videos on this channel,
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GetIntoGameDev">GetIntoGameDev</a>,
        gave me the impression that Andrew, who’s behind the channel, has a deep
        passion for graphics programming, and for teaching it. If you are
        interested in next-gen graphic libraries such as DirectX 12, Vulkan, and
        Metal, I’d highly encourage you to check out the channel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Andrew took good time explaining the fundamental principles, and I felt
        like I managed to grasp concepts like pipeline, renderer, and the
        language <i>WGSL</i> better from these videos.
      </p>
      <p>Before I stopped, I managed to make this colourful triangle.</p>
      <canvas width="320" height="256" id="beginners-canvas"></canvas>
      <script src="beginners_progress.js"></script>
      <p>
        I stopped following these videos herefor two reasons. 1) The videos were
        geared towards beginners who already had experience in GPU programming,
        but not so much in JavaScript and Node.js. I was the opposite – I had
        plenty of experience in creating user interfaces with JavaScript, but
        had never worked with anything resembling a GPU library. And 2) I
        realised I was specifically learning about graphics. What I wanted to do
        was perform matrix computations in parallel. I imagine that most people
        looking into GPU libraries do so for graphic processing, and for such a
        young library as WebGPU, I don't know if I can really expect many
        resources focused on learning WebGPU for non-graphic computations.
      </p>
      <h1 id="webgpu-fundamentals">WebGPU Fundamentals</h1>
      <p>
        So looking for something specifically teaching WebGPU for parallel
        computations, I found
        <a
          href="https://webgpufundamentals.org/webgpu/lessons/webgpu-fundamentals.html"
          >this website dedicated to teaching WebGPU</a
        >, written by <a href="https://github.com/greggman">Gregg Tavares</a>. I
        started from the beginning, trying to solidify my undersanding of the
        fundamentals again, skipped the part about graphics (vertex and fragment
        shaders) and jumped directly to
        <a
          href="https://webgpufundamentals.org/webgpu/lessons/webgpu-fundamentals.html#a-run-computations-on-the-gpu"
          >the precious compute shaders</a
        >. I’ve only worked with this today, but I feel pretty certain I’ve
        finally found the resource teaching me what I want to learn.
      </p>
      <p>See this!</p>
      <canvas id="computation-canvas" width="0" height="0"></canvas>
      <div id="message-box"></div>
      <script src="computation-progress.js"></script>
      <p>
        I know this doesn't look very impressive as I could easily have made
        this with a simple script. However, this is special because we are
        performing parallel computations on the GPU. I'm excited to learn more
        of compute shaders, as I believe they will be invaluable in enabling me
        to perform large-scale matrix calculations for Battleground Builder.
