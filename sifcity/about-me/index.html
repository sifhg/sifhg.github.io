        <p>I am Sif.</p>
        <p>I am a scholar of urban culture with a background in Musicology.  </p>
        <p>I am based in Copenhagen, Denmark. This city serves as my home and my academic starting point for understanding cities. From here, I analyze and compare urban spaces across the world, drawing on the attributes and challenges of Copenhagen as a lens for my research.  </p>
        <p>In 2021, I faced challenges related to harassment that targeted a minority aspect of my identity. In my escape from harassment, I found myself homeless, spending the nights on a boat. Even though it appeared that the community around the marina was not what I hoped for, and I was confronted with some of the dangers of living in a place distant from the law, I did not realize that I was living on the rock bottom of Copenhagen until the winter made its entry. These events interrupted my exploration of Queer theory and concepts of monsters on my previous blog, Monstromusi.</p>
        <p>Navigating through Copenhagen from below, I got to meet the city and the inhabitants from a new perspective. I met women from different walks of life, hardened by really unfortunate life situations: including financially abused sex workers and survivors of partner violence. From their stories, these women knew the insufficiency of this city’s welfare, which would often overlook people, while they were falling through the cracks. These women would know how to navigate against the violence of the bottom, where poverty and bureaucracy hit the hardest.</p>
        <p>These life events of mine and the stories of others opened my eyes to the hidden spaces of Copenhagen and her inhabitants: I became conceptually aware of “the city” in a new way. These insights led me to shift my academic path from Musicology to Urban Culture, a field to which I want to dedicate myself. I have now put old Monstromusi to the grave and built <a href="https://sifhg.github.io/monstromusi/">a digital mausoleum</a>, where followers of the past can visit and reminisce about old blog posts. And now I am developing this blog, Sif City, to document this new path: as a space for gathering my thoughts and experiences of urban culture and city planning.</p>

                <p>The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
                    exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
                    and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an &quot;owner&quot;) of an original work of
                    authorship and/or a database (each, a &quot;Work&quot;).</p>
                <p>Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
                    the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
                    scientific works (&quot;Commons&quot;) that the public can reliably and without fear
                    of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
                    works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
                    and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
                    These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
                    culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
                    works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in

                    associating CC0 with a Work (the &quot;Affirmer&quot;), to the extent that he or she
                    is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
                    elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
                    terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
                    Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.</p>

                            v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
                            in a Work;

                            of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
                            irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
                            Affirmer&#39;s Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
                            of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
                            future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
                            worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
                            treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
                            medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
                            including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
                            purposes (the &quot;Waiver&quot;). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
                            member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer&#39;s heirs and
                            successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
                            revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
                            equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
                            as contemplated by Affirmer&#39;s express Statement of Purpose.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
                            be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
                            Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
                            account Affirmer&#39;s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
                            extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
                            person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
                            irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer&#39;s Copyright and
                            Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
                            maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
                            time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
                            of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
                            limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
                            &quot;License&quot;). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
                            applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
                            reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
                            partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
                            of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
                            will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
                            Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
                            action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer&#39;s
                            express Statement of Purpose.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Limitations and Disclaimers.</p>
                        <p>a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
                            surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
                            b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
                            warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
                            statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
                            title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
                            infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
                            the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
                            the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
                            c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
                            that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
                            limitation any person&#39;s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
                            Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
                            consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
                            Work.
                            d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
