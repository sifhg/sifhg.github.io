        <p>Written by <em>Sif Høg</em>, 28/02/2024</p>
        <p>I have been planning on writing a post on an example of dark design in my own city, and yesterday I went out to take a picture of an example of dark design. It was a classic example of a dark design bench: a bench with obstacles that make it unusable for homeless people looking for a slightly less uncomfortable place than the ground to sleep at night. These kinds of benches are usually designed with impractical shapes and sculptures disguised as artsy.</p>
        <p>Last year, I went on a city walk in Copenhagen, where I was made aware of the benches at Israel&#39;s Square near Nørreport; they were designed with armrests and shapes arching into accessibility. So it was natural for me to go there to take pictures for my blog post yesterday.</p>
        <p>But when I got there and looked at the benches, I was not convinced about their inaccessibility. Looking at the benches I could indeed see that they were round, and they did have armrests uncomfortable to lie on, but my inner scepticism insisted on asking: Is there not enough space for an adult person to lie on the area without armrests? And are they actually so curved that the benches are uncomfortable to lie on? I decided to try and lie on one of the benches, and from this ad hoc test, they did not feel any less convenient than other benches for lying on. I would even say the armrests were at a comfortable height and if I covered them in something soft, they could serve as pillows.</p>
        <p>I do not want to neglect the issues with dark design, nor that this bench might have proved to have issues, if I actually attempted to sleep on it overnight. I know Copenhagen sadly has plenty of examples of dark design around, and the purpose of this blog post is not to argue that might be wrong.</p>
        <p>This experience yesterday showed me the importance of research and critical thinking. Having a blog where I share my knowledge allows me to put what I think I know to the test.</p>
        <p> When I plan to write a blog post, my research often forces me to consider holes and weaknesses in my knowledge, leading me in a new direction. This gives me the opportunity to explore and write about what I have learned from this shift.</p>
        <p>I am still planning on writing about inaccessible benches. I know some other ones with sculptures on them, making them undoubtedly unusable for sleeping.</p>
        <p>Here is the picture I got of the benches. Feel free to make your own judgement of them.</p>
