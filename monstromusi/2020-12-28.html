<h2>Skimming Literature on X-Gender in Japan</h2>

<p>Recently, I wrote about getting <a href="https://monstromusi.com/2020/12/20/back-in-the-saddle/">“Back in the Saddle”</a> by structurally skimming through texts to get a comprehensive view of what I need for my project. <em>Pass one</em> of the three-pass approach that Keshav explains in “How to Read a Paper” (2011) consists in:</p>



<ol type="1"><li><em>Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction</em></li><li><em>Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else</em></li><li><em>Read the conclusions</em></li><li><em>Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you’ve already read</em> (Keshav 2011)</li></ol>



<p>I tried this approach when skimming the chapter “Transgender, non-binary genders, and intersex in Japan” (Dale 2019) in the edited book <em>The Routledge Companion to Gender and Japanese Culture</em>. This is what I found out from just doing the four quick steps.</p>



<p>In the chapter, Dale delivers a historical view on transgender, non-binary, and gender-bending representation in Japan through the decades of the twentieth century. Dale mentions the 1980s specifically as a golden era for transgender people in Japan. This could be useful as my project concerns the band Malice Mizer that formed in 1992. The chapter also aims to explore the usage of the term <em>x-gender</em>: a term to describe non-binary gender in Japan. The “x” in this term makes me curious about the origin of the term as I wonder whether it shares anything with the visual kei band X-Japan, which Japanese people often just mention as X. Except for my curiosity, I have no urgent desire to explore that term further for this project.</p>



<p>Glancing over the references, I only know one of them: Jack Halberstam’s book <em>Trans*: A Quick and Quirky Account of Gender Variability</em>. I can tell from this, that Dale is up to date on one of the most contemporary and well-known researchers in the field of queer theory on trans*. The rest of the references are primarily to Japanese literature by academics with Japanese names. I do not know these academics (because of the language barrier) but they indicate that Dale bases her research on theories by people with firsthand insights into Japanese cultures and not on interpretations by outsiders.</p>



<p>To my project, Dale’s chapter could contribute a link between the field of Japanese popular cultures and transgender studies. However, I hesitate to put it on my bibliography because my project is also my exam, and because of the literature cap, I have to limit my bibliography. My bibliography contains sufficient literature on transgender studies at this point, so I do not necessarily need more. Also, the point in my project concerns how <em>eggs</em> (people who do not view themselves as transgender <em>yet</em>) identify with Malice Mizer’s gender-bending performance while not being considered transgender.</p>



<p>I would say I found out quite a lot about Dale’s chapter by using Keshav’s approach to quickly get a comprehensive view.</p>
