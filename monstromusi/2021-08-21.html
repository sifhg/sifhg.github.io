<h2>Six Statements about Pride and Four Reasons Visit the Theatre this September</h2>

<p>Yesterday evening, I went to the theatre to watch the performance Pride (written by Falk Richter in collaboration with the performers) at The Danish Royal Theatre in Copenhagen . At this moment, it is still hard for me to put into words how this performance is both a very important as well as a deeply emotionally touching piece of art. So allow me to reduce my language to a list of statements about the performance, Pride.</p>



<ul><li>Pride is a series of stories about the harsh and wonderful realities of queers.</li><li>Pride is an artaudianly sensational storm that blows any assumption about what is normal miles away, so the audience will be open to non-normative realities.</li><li>Pride is a statement that it is fucking possible to scatter queer pride from the royal stage of the Kingdom of Denmark. That is quite a lot of progress.</li><li>Pride reminds us of the horrors that queers live through in other countries in our European Union. How is it possible that human rights are less relevant for people because of their sexuality or gender identity within our union? We should not accept that</li><li>Pride proves that other family constellations than the one-mom-one-dad constellation are completely valid.</li><li>Pride is a riot of encouragement for societal change.</li></ul>



<p>I believe this performance might be an important encouragement for social change so that queers will not have to fear being hurt, imprisoned, or killed for loving whom they love and living as the gender that they truly are. So why should you visit The Royal Theatre of Copenhagen this September? Here are four answers to that question.</p>



<ul><li>To understand what this <em>discrimination</em> is all about.</li><li>To learn about the lived realities of queers.</li><li>To get encouraged push back against discrimination.</li><li>To realize how life can be lived in ways alternative to traditional family structures.</li></ul>



<p>The performance is in English with Danish surtitles.</p>
