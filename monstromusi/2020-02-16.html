<h2>The Start of a Year of Choreomusicology</h2>
<p>As a part of my search for musical <em>monsters</em>, I will spend this year introducing myself to the field of <em>choreomusicology</em>. <em>Choreomusicology </em>is the study of relationships between music and dance. I do this because I believe that musical monsters cannot be fully understood by only investigating its existence in a purely musicological <em>space</em>.</p>



<p class="dotted">In accordance with the theatrologist Mette Tranholm’s understanding of theatrical characters as being a psychic and a physical essence that are tied together (Tranholm 2017, 11), the monster contains this psychic/physical-synergy as well. My thesis is that person-like beings such as characters and monsters can only exist socially to the extent that they are acknowledged as existing beings by other social actors. This leads me to an examination of the spaces in which the social interactions that incarnates monsters happen.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Dance Space</h4>



<p>Music can evoke emotions in the person listening to it by means of psychological mechanisms such as <em>emotional contagion</em> (Juslin and Västfjäll 2008, 559). Reading the introductory chapter in the book “Music-Dance” by the dance scholar Patrizia Veroli and the music historian Gianfranco Vinay (2018), dance seems to affect the person looking at the dance in a similar manner, so that one can think of dance as a bodily-visual language that can be used to communicate emotions from dancers to viewers. In order to keep the <em>monsters</em> within sight, I can make this project an investigation of <em>dance space</em>: a continuation of the Clifford-Napoleone’s <em>queerscape</em> in heavy metal. I still need a case though; it could be a <em>thick analysis</em> of a recorded live performance of a queer metal band, where I look into the social consequences of the synthesis between the events in both <em>sonic</em> and <em>dance space</em>.</p>

<p>EDIT 04-10-2021: When I wrote this post, I had misunderstood choreomusicology as a discipline where a choreological and a musicological analysis were made in parallel but separately to make a shared conclusion based on findings from both analyses. Instead, choreomusicology is a unique discipline concerning the special methodology that is necessary when studying the relationship between choreology and musicology. For an introduction and overview of choreomusicology, I suggest looking at the website dedicated to the topic: <a href="https://choreomusicology.wordpress.com/">choreomusicology.wordpress.com</a>. </p>
