<h2>Choosing the Fittest Limbs for my Monster</h2>

<p>Last year, I told you about my plans for <a href="https://monstromusi.com/2020/06/21/infusing-life-into-a-persona/">“Infusing Life into a Persona”</a>. I have gathered most of the previous research needed, and now, I am about to get concrete. I have almost gathered all the limbs for my artificial person; I only need to decide a few last parts. When I ignite my person, I want them to be rebellious and reckless; I want a monster that does not accept exploitation and minorization. I want seductive parts in my monster so it can gather masses. I want it to have an exterior that can tolerate pain, so it does not care about police brutality. I know exactly where I can find all of this: Pussy Riot – my creature needs a pussy riot.</p>



<p>The qualities of Pussy Riot would fit just perfectly into my ideal monster, but I have some concerns about the compatibility of the flesh. The other parts are from Lady Gaga and Kim Larsen and even though they provide substantially different functionalities, their bodies are trained to perform in similar environments: on stages in front of an admiring audience. Pussy Riot, on the other hand, find their power in approaching unprepared and unwilling audiences to shock them. The shock forms a wave that propagates across denyingly calm waters. Unlike the performances of Lady Gaga and Kim Larsen, it is the shock wave – not the live performance itself – that meets the admiring audience.</p>



<p>To fuse this flesh, I need to figure out how I can make the <em>stages </em>compatible. How far can I stretch the concept of <em>stage</em> without it rips and becomes indifferent to any other space? If a screen displaying a YouTube video is a stage, the stage is degraded to something that does not convey the engulfing experience of the live performance. Is the altar in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour a stage? Did Pussy Riot’s performance there engulf the displeased audience? Does the audience need to be admiring, or could indignation also work in my general concept of the <em>musical personage</em>?</p>
