<h2>Infusing Life Into a “Persona”</h2>

<p>I want to define a new concept of <em>musical persona</em> that both consider the performing body as an interpretable character as well as a social agent with political influence on society. As Frankenstein formed a living monster by compounding dead bodies, I form my concept of a musical persona by synthesizing concepts of <em>characters</em> from performance studies, perception of <em>persons</em> from cognitive social psychology, and social <em>actors</em> from sociology. One thing that performed characters and social actors have in common is that they appear as persons. By considering the perspectives of all three disciplines, I infuse my concept of character with insights into the monstrous power of interpretive, artificial persons.</p>



<p>Personas carry seductive powers of theatrical characters, though they appear with the legitimacy of real persons, which weakens our suspicions toward them. When they have gained the trust of a myriad, they interfere with society as social actors. Capital is power, and they have become what constitutes <em>cultural capital</em>.</p>



<p>EDIT 02-10-2021: I have decided to call the concept &#8220;personage&#8221; instead of &#8220;persona&#8221;</p>
