<h2>Axolotls Find Their Own Paths</h2>

<p>Rites are the <em>methods</em> we call to initiate becoming. Some rites are deeply ingrained traditions: so deeply, that refusing them does not even seem like a possibility. Some rites initiate becoming adults and rely heavily on biological functions; and because these ritual occurrences are biological, becoming an adult appears as an inevitable law of nature. One type of rites is puberties, where sex characteristics of the body become more accentuated, and one’s sociocultural age goes from girl to woman or from boy to man, normatively speaking. Another such rite of adulthood is pregnancy, where women are expected to become mothers. Axolotls, Mexican salamander monsters, violate this law of nature and choose their own paths.</p>



<p>Yesterday, I came across a blog post about axolotls, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://vanege.medium.com/la-aksolotla-protesto-97c1cbddb7e" target="_blank">“La aksolotla protesto”</a> by the Esperanto blogger Vanege (2021). The post is a cutely written fable about (not) becoming an adult in a community of salamanders. The salamanders traditionally drink a brown liquid of adult-becoming. When the salamanders become adults, their skin changes, they stop living in the water and move on land. No salamander has ever questioned this tradition until the axolotls started refusing it by saying:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify" style="margin-left:40px;"><font size="3">“The lake is warm and comfortable.” “I already like how I look.” “Don’t change me.” […] “My body, my choice.”</font><br><font size="3"></font></p><p align="right"><font size="3">(Vanege 2021; my translation *)</font></p>



<p>The axolotls insisted on their right to stay young despite the water becoming murky and many warnings from the adult salamanders.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify" style="margin-left:40px;"><font size="3">“The gods will punish your disrespect.” […] “You can’t stay in the water!” “Drink, and come live with us on land!”</font><br><font size="3"></font></p><p align="right"><font size="3">(Vanege 2021; my translation **)</font></p>



<p>At some point, the lake had become too murky for the adult salamanders to see whether the axolotls were still living there. Then the adult salamanders moved on and condemned the axolotls as an example of the consequences of not following the traditions. In reality, the axolotls were exposed to neither death nor misery; instead, they have made their own land of youth. Monkeys found these fascinating creatures and worshipped them as gods (Vanege 2021).</p>

<p>There is a comfortable atmosphere surrounding traditional rites because we know where they will take us and because our acquaintances talk so positively about them; but what if we cannot identify with the becoming associated with the traditional rites? What if a girl does not desire the obligations of motherhood or if a child does not identify with their assigned sex characteristics that their puberty will accentuate? The adult salamanders (and other conservatives) that only approve of taking the same path of rites as they did only speak for their own experiences of becoming; they think they protect the axolotls from the unknown but they cannot comprehend the dysphoria of being squeezed into a biological becoming of something that does not match one’s identity. One can truly protect an axolotl, only by acknowledging what dysphoria means to it.</p>



<p>The axolotls have a cute affect on the adult salamanders. Being forever young, they appear as incapable creatures in need of protection. This affect inspires a desire to turn the axolotls into undermined objects of the adult salamanders’ self-proclaimed, mature integrity. By denying the protection offered by the adult salamanders, the axolotls are independent subjects with an agency.</p>



<p>In Benedicte de Thurah Huang’s investigation of the aesthetic <em>gurlesque</em> (2015), she elaborates on Butler’s observation that “[…] a stable sex [is] expressed through a stable gender” (Butler [1990] 2007, 208n.6). de Thurah Huang states that there is a discursive dynamic between biological age and sociocultural age similar to Butler’s observation.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify" style="margin-left:40px;"><font size="3">The biological age of a woman plays a significant role in the heterosexual matrix because it determines her fertility and ability to reproduce the heterosexual family structure. Like gender, according to Butler, is heteronormatively understood as an expression of sex, there is a norm where the gender is culturally displayed in agreement with the biological age: The girl is expected to become a mother, and motherhood draws a defining line between girl and woman so that a social construction makes the possibility of simultaneously being a girl (child/young) and mother (adult) difficult if not impossible. Within the heterosexual matrix, one can only stay a girl by renouncing motherhood. The norm of the matrix, where the woman is created by virtue of the man […], classifies ‘the old girl’ without a husband and a child as a perversity, a dried-up cocoon […]</font><br><font size="3"></font></p><p align="right"><font size="3">(de Thurah Huang 2015, 17; my translation ***)</font></p>



<p>From de Thurah Huang, I can derive that the heterosexual matrix insists on a standard temporality where girls go from being one gender to becoming another one: from being a girl to becoming a woman. This girl/woman-dichotomy forces girls into a new set of expectations so that girls have to develop new strategies of social navigation. This is not much different from what the axolotls will experience if they become adults; they will need to leave the warm and comfortable lake and figure out how to live on land. It is not necessarily desirable to become a woman or a man. Like the axolotls who did not desire becoming adults because “[they] already like how [they] look.” (Vanege 2021), a girl does not fancy becoming a man or becoming a gender that exists by virtue of a man. The matrix punishes both girls and axolotls if they ignore the rites of adulthood by condemning them as perversities, dried-up cocoons (de Thurah Huang 2015, 17), and disrespectful to the gods (Vanege 2021). It seems that those who uncritically have followed the heteronormative path to adulthood get provoked by those who refuse the rites.</p>



<p>These condemnations are meant as punishments, but we do not need to receive them as such. In the introductory chapter of the poem book, <em>Gurlesque</em>, Arielle Greenberg explains how some <em>riot grrls</em> create their own empowering language by utilizing the condemning vocabulary that was supposed to punish them. “Some grrls wrote words like ‘bitch’ and ‘cunt’ and ‘dyke’ on themselves with black marker or lipstick. Riot grrls also wanted to take back language, take back girlhood, take back their lives.” (Greenberg 2010, 5). Similarly, the axolotls could only achieve their desires by becoming, what the adult salamanders had condemned; the axolotls became aquatic monsters that refused and glitched what seems like an inevitable becoming. In the book <em>Glitch Feminism</em>, the black cyberfeminist, Legacy Russell, points out that “[g]litch is all about traversing along edges and stepping to the limits […] on our journey to defining ourselves” (Russell 2020, 22). This is exactly what the axolotls in Vanege’s blog post do. The axolotls&#8217; glitching of the the matrix causes it to divide and create a new mutant reality. The axolotls ghosted the adult salamanders. In the reality of the adult salamanders, the axolotls were all dead, but from axolotls’ perspective, they escaped adulthood and became gods: programmers of an axolotl utopia where monkeys worship these eternally young creators.</p>



<p>Humans might want to refuse the rite of puberty as well. Young people whose gender identities dissonate with their sex often experience discursive resistance from the surrounding matrix that is similar to the resistance that the axolotls experienced. Institutions call us <em>confused</em>, TERFs call us <em>frauds</em>, and the so-called “gender critical” activists call us <em>future rapists</em>. Those condemnations are expressions of capitalist fear of divergence. It should nevertheless be every young person’s right to refuse their standard form of becoming an adult and instead choose the puberty that suits them the best.</p>

<p>*** “Kvindens biologiske alder spiller en stor rolle i den heteroseksuelle matrice, fordi den bestemmer fertilitet og evne til at reproducere den heteroseksuelle familiestruktur. Ligesom det kulturelle køn, ifølge Butler, heteronormativt forstås som udtryk for det biologiske køn, er der en norm for at kønnet udfoldes kulturelt i overensstemmelse med den biologiske alder: Pigen forventes at blive mor, og moderskabet trækker en definitiv grænse mellem pige og kvinde, således at en social konstruktion udelukker eller vanskeliggør muligheden for at være pige (barn/ung) og mor (voksen) samtidig. I den heteroseksuelle matrice forbliver man kun pige, hvis man frasiger sig moderskab. Matricens norm […] kategoriserer den ‘gamle pige’ uden mand og barn som en perversitet, en ‘indtørret’ puppe […]” (de Thurah Huang 2015, 17).</p>
