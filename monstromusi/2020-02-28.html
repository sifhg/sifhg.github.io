<h2>Failure as a Queer Practice</h2>

<p>Finally, I got an opportunity to get a closer look at the book “The Queer Art of Failure” by the queer theorist Jack Halberstam (2011). When I wrote my bachelor thesis, I shortly mentioned the symbolic usage of smeared lipstick in a music video by the band Dadaroma (2018). Now, I work on a blog post that explores this symbolism closer than I was able to in my thesis, and in this upcoming exploration, I will look at ‘smeared lipstick’ through the analytic perspective of this book. Today, I want to go through some of the points from the book that struck me as particularly interesting.</p>



<p>Halberstam says that&nbsp;<em>success</em>&nbsp;in a society is measured by one’s ability to accumulate wealth and to conform to the needs of that society to stay stable. In this regard,&nbsp;<em>failure</em>&nbsp;is a necessary practice for queer identities to be happy because their desires do not correspond with the measures of <em>success</em> in the existing society. He explores alternative ways of living, and in doing so, he also challenges the conformity of academic norms by taking philosophical detours that do not serve to answer his current research question. He allows himself to finish impulsive thoughts that might bring forth new ideas. He is not only searching for alternative ways of living but also for alternative ways of researching. Referring to Foucault, Halberstam concludes that ‘academic&nbsp;disciplines’&nbsp;are a technique of modern power that produces experts and administrative power to help the existing structure lasting through normalization (Halberstam 2011, 6-8). I consider this an encouragement to seek ways to think thoughts that are not encouraged by the university structure itself. This detour from conventional thinking can catalyze new, untraditional discoveries.</p>



<p>He uses the concept ‘low theory’ that is adopted from Stuart Hall’s chapter “Gramsci’s Relevance for the Study of Race and Ethnicity.” Halberstam says: “Low theory tries to locate all the in-between spaces that save us from being snared by the hooks of hegemony […]” (Halberstam 2011, 2). It is relevant to ask, who Halberstam is referring to when using the word “us”? It might feel obvious to say that he is referring to ‘queer individuals’; though, I do believe “us” would be referring to ‘people in general’. I see the hegemonic normativity of society as an ideal imagination that people strive towards in the hope of achieving <em>success</em>, while everyone is deemed to <em>fail</em> eventually. I should probably read Stuart Hall’s chapter to understand Halberstam’s concept of ‘low theory’ sufficiently.</p>



<p>One thing that I like about “The Queer Art of Failure” is its metaphorical language; in complete agreement with my project of this blog, Halberstam explores&nbsp;<em>monstrous beings</em>&nbsp;in his search for alternative ways of being. The book is both bright and silly in its exploration of children’s entertainment such as SpongeBob SquarePants and Monsters, Inc. as well as dark and gloomy as it reminds us of the Nazism’s attempt to extinguish homosexuality (Halberstam 2011, 23). Children are not expected to live up to the norms of society, and therefore their cultural material is a great source of alternative ideas of how life can be.</p>



<p>One last thing that I think is worth pointing out is that Halberstam presents&nbsp;<em>The Many-Headed Hydra</em>, that is a <em>monster</em> that grows stronger as you try to defeat it; every time one of its heads are chopped off, several new ones grow out (Halberstam 2011, 18-9). I should look closer into the nature of this&nbsp;<em>monster</em>&nbsp;so that I know how to treat it, if I see it in the wild. At this very early stage of my <em>monster studies</em>, it seems to be a&nbsp;<em>monster</em>&nbsp;that is most easily incarnated in abstract structures such as academia. When I want to learn something new in academia, I read some literature about it, and this literature always has a list of references at the end that are necessary to read in order to truly understand what I have just read; then I read what I find relevant in that list of literature, which ends up requiring me to read even more. Every time a researcher fills in a blank spot in their knowledge, at least two new blank spots occur. Research demands exponentially more research, and in this way, academia as a&nbsp;<em>phenomenon&nbsp;</em>starves academia as an&nbsp;<em>institution</em>&nbsp;because the institution has to constantly provide the researchers with material facilities that the uncontrollable growth of knowledge requires.</p>
