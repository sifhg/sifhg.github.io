<h2>In the Search for Acknowledgement of Queer Metal Identities</h2>

<p>One year ago today, I departed from Copenhagen Airport to arrive in Tokyo 12 hours later: fled from heteronormative western norms regarding metal music and went into the field of my bachelor thesis. My field was the musical style&nbsp;<em>visual kei</em>. At first glance, this might sound like a niche project with relevance to only a small group of people interested in Japanese&nbsp;<em>girls’ metal</em>. However, my project proposes specifically two points that make it significant to a much broader crowd of scholars: one point regarding social acknowledgement of&nbsp;queer identities&nbsp;and one regarding the interdisciplinary potential of the theoretical concept <em>disincarnation</em> (Tranholm 2017).</p>



<p>When engaging in casual conversations about metal music and reading magazine content by music critics in the West, one most often is surrounded by heteronormative discourses; those discourses can only allow men to appear feminine (or <em>non-masculine</em>), if these men are <em>othered </em>and made objects of ridicule, whereby their worths are reduced to their levels of fun and their personal dignities are erased. The nature of this kind of objectification shares some dynamics with <em>sexual </em>objectifications of <em>women</em> as both erase personal worth by means of the sexuality of the objectified individual. Subversion of such discourses appears very difficult when enclosed by their fog. This is why I chose to fly out of it and look into the nature of visual kei. Visual kei is a musical style that successfully keeps the dignity of the musicians that perform with aesthetics defying masculine norms. Using the theorization of the theatrologist Mette Tranholm, I considered how a character representing an assemblage of visual kei symbols can disincarnate hegemonic masculinities and deconstruct masculine heterosexual norms within metal.</p>
