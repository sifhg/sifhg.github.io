<h2>Monsters in the Matrix</h2>

<p>I have been looking for monsters for some time now and I must say that they are hard to find. According to the historian Michel Foucault’s definition of <em>monsters</em>, their “[…] existence and form is […] a violation of the laws of nature” (Foucault 2003, 55-6). This detail makes me struggle to find the monsters; where does one go to see something that violates <em>the laws of nature</em>? Is it even possible to violate the laws of nature?</p>



<p>I discussed the concept of <em>glitch</em> with a friend, a computer scientist, the other day. We tried to find a common base for talking about glitches both within aesthetics and within computer science simultaneously without compromising the usage of the term within any of the fields. By acknowledging that humans live within social machinery, one realizes that glitches can appear anywhere in the matrix: not only in digital computers.</p>



<p>When Neo says in the movie <em>The Matrix</em> that he does not like the idea of not being in control of his life, Morpheus responds:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify" style="margin-left:40px;"><font size="3">You&#8217;re here because you know something. What you know you can&#8217;t explain, but you feel it. You&#8217;ve felt it your entire life, that there&#8217;s something wrong with the world. You don&#8217;t know what it is, but it&#8217;s there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to me. Do you know what I&#8217;m talking about?

<p>After drawing attention to this uncomfortable issue, Morpheus uncovers the matrix.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify" style="margin-left:40px;"><font size="3">The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work&#8230; when you go to church&#8230; when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.

<p>It is not only from science fiction movies that we know this idea of a matrix as “the world that has been pulled over your eyes” and determines one’s experience life. The queer theorist Judith Butler defines the <em>heterosexual matrix</em> as “[…] that grid of cultural intelligibility through which bodies, genders, and desires are naturalized.” (Butler [1990] 2007, 208n.6). A matrix is a programmed machine that constitutes our realities (and experiences of nature). It is the milieu that determines our possibilities of navigation within the program. As my computer science friend reminded me, when creating a program, one usually has a definite idea of how they want the program to behave and what they want it to do. A glitch then, appears either where the programmer unintentionally has made the program able to act against its purpose, or when the system is stressed so much that its structure cannot maintain the process. The presence of glitches is not unique for digital programs. All machinery that is programmed – digitally, socially, or culturally – by humans tends to have inherited human fallibility from their creators. If we manage to localize the spots where one can provoke a glitch, we have found a spot where one can act against the rules of the matrix: violate the laws of reality. Spots of monstrous opportunities, prohibited by nature, might hide just behind the backdrop of the matrix. If we know such a spot, not only do we know where monsters can exist, we might even become monsters ourselves.</p>



<p>So let us have a look at the capitalist matrix to which most of us are subjects. The book “The Queer Art of Failure” by Jack Halberstam (2011) pivots around the question of individual success within a capitalist structure. In capitalism, success is a reward that takes the form either of economic profit or of an illusion of wealth infused by the ideology of positive thinking. Those that receive success are those that stabilize the structure by reproducing and refining its power structure (Halberstam 2011, 6-11). While the capitalist matrix bribes humans that reproduce capitalist power structures with its definition of wealth, it deems others to fail, if they do not desire the capitalist conditions. Engels draws a connection between the private property and the monogamous family as being the standard economic unit of society for proletarians (Engels [1908] 2010, 199-200). Because the monogamous, heteronormative family has proven to function well as the economic units of capitalist society, the matrix rewards people with the infatuating notion that they have accomplished the highest social goal, if they live by these norms. In other words: the capitalist matrix is programmed to make people live in monogamous, heteronormative families. We can now conclude that social groups of queer kinships are forms of glitches because they violate the laws of the capitalist matrix.</p>



<p>Just recently, polli gin, which is a fellow musicologist and an invaluable friend of mine, disclosed the great possibilities of glitch to me, when it lent me the book <em>Glitch Feminism</em> by the black cyberfeminist, Legacy Russell. Similar to Engels, Russell criticizes the use of gender in capitalism: “Gender is a scaled economy: it is a mode of regulation, management, and control. It allows for the reification of process, the division of labor, and the exchange of value under the umbrella of capitalism.” (Russell 2020, 63). What Russell can add to this critique of capitalism a century after Engels, is an elaborated awareness of the binary gender discourse. This enables her to encourage not only the elimination of private property but also the glitching of the notion that the body is binary. This notion is what enables the regulation of us.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify" style="margin-left:40px;"><font size="3">When we reject the binary, we reject the economy that goes along with it. When we reject the binary, we challenge how we are valued in a capitalist society that yokes our gender to the labor we enact. When we reject the binary, we claim uselessness as a strategic tool. Useless, we disappear, ghosting on the binary body.

<p>By utilizing unintended functionality or by stressing the matrices that exploit us, we can defy their rules and become monsters. This becoming gives us the power to push back against the structures that determine our consciousness and we, ourselves, become creators of reality.</p>
