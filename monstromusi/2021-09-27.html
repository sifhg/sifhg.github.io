<h2>The Roundtable of Knowledge</h2>

<p>When I started reading the introduction of an article that my supervisor had handed me, I was immediately confused. The title of the article was “K-pop – What’s in a Name?” by the scholar of comparative literature Dr. Candace Epps-Robertson and the “Physicist by day, (amateur poet by night)” Katie Hulme (2020) and I expected an introduction to an academic approach to identifying K-pop. Instead of K-pop, the text immediately presented me with abstract thoughts on learning as a conversation of wisdom within a network. This stream of thoughts led to comparisons to the roundtable of the legend King Author. “How is this relevant to K-pop,” I thought.</p>



<p>After reading the introduction, I leafed through the article to find the conclusion; instead of finding&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;conclusion, I found two headings:&nbsp;<em>Concluding Statements</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Editor’s Conclusion</em>. I was immediately confused by this atypical text until I figured out that Epps-Robertson and Hulme did not exactly write the article; they rather edited the written outputs of digital&nbsp;<em>roundtable</em>&nbsp;discussions. By facilitating roundtables of BTS fans on Twitter and a panel of participants with different experiences and expertise on K-pop, the editors utilized discussions as knowledge factories to gather diverse perspectives on communities of young Koreans identifying with K-pop and on what qualifies as K-pop under what circumstances. I expected&nbsp;<em>a</em>&nbsp;conclusion gathering knowledge from an investigation of K-pop communities; instead, I got seven conclusions: six with different findings of the roundtable discussions and one by the editors concluding that the method has found diverse knowledge. When I read the title of the article, I expected knowledge on K-pop-dependent communities, and I did get that, but what was even more valuable to me was a new method for fabricating perspectives on a topic by gathering roundtables.</p>
