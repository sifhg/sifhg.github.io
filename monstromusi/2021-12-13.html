<h2>A Seducer and its Worshippers</h2>

<p>Matrices are programmed by individuals that suggest new ways of doing things and collectives of humans enacting what patterns qualify to get normalized. I have already talked about the functionality and programming of matrices as well as the monstrous act of utilizing glitches in matrices in <a href="https://monstromusi.com/2021/03/16/monsters-in-the-matrix/">“Monsters in the Matrix”</a>. My personage monster utilizes a glitch in the matrix that enables it to gain access to the backend side of the matrix through mass seduction of the humans carrying the norms of the matrix. When my monster has gained access to the backend side, it can hardcode a new reality among a larger group of its worshippers. Ensuring such seductive powers was one of the most significant goals when I was considering the fittest parts in <a href="https://monstromusi.com/2021/10/04/choosing-the-fittest-limbs-for-my-monster/">“Choosing the Fittest Limbs for my Monster”</a>.</p>



<p>My personage monster calls this seductive power method when performing in front of big crowds. On the music stage, it performs as per its own beliefs – recklessly denying dissonating norms in the world outside the concert setting – and it allows the people in the audience to dissociate from their everyday lives and focus all their attention on the order suggested on stage. In contrast to classical theatre performers, my musical personage continuously breaks The Fourth Wall without alienating its performance from the audience. It completely dissolves the illusion of The Fourth Wall. Now, there is no longer a boundary distancing the performance from the crowd; instead, the boundaries left distance the outside world from the musical event, and the crowd experience a shared room with the performer. This allows the people in the audience to dissociate their everyday life and delve into a new reality that is formed ways to see the world that my monster presents.</p>



<p>These dynamics are possible because people’s identities are in flux and therefore open to new material to define themselves. In the introductory chapter of Lorraine Gamman and Margaret Marshment’s <em>The Female Gaze</em>, they note that “[It is from popular culture] that most people in our society get their entertainment and their information. It is here that women (and men) are offered the culture’s dominant definitions of themselves” (Gamman and Marshment 1988, 2). This means that humans can become fans of performers in their searches for identity symbols that they can use to define themselves. Relying on Gamma and Marshment, I argue that public personages offer these symbols to women (and men), and to access material to build identities, people study, consume, and identify with cultural personages; in other words.</p>



<p>In the psychology journal article <em>Conceptualization and measurement of celebrity worship</em>, Lynn McCutcheon et al. presents a psychological theoretical framework that confirms this dynamic. In the process of obtaining the identity constructing material, one develops a parasocial relationship to the personage that (even though it is impersonal) evoke emotional and cognitive processes that resemble those of personal relationships (McCutcheon 2002, 68); this is when people become fans. It is when these feelings of social identification occur that people experience that their identities flux; they dissociate from some of their ideas to make room for this new identification with the personage.</p>



<p>McCutcheon argues that fans experience an <em>absorption</em>, which is also the central cognitive feature of hypnosis. When absorbed, people experience attention to something that, in contrast to <em>concentration</em>, is effortless. &nbsp;The absorption makes people experience a heightened sense of reality that motivates a desire to learn about and identify with the admired personage (McCutcheon 2002, 81). In my monster, I would like to utilize these psychological mechanisms, so that it absorbs the carriers of the matrix, to access the backend and program new views on the world into our society.</p>
