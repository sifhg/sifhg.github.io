<h2>Gazes, Sluts, and Ridiculizations</h2>

<p>This semester, I am taking a course called <em>Pop: Passion and Aversion</em>, and I am pleased that the curriculum gives me an opportunity to gaze through Laura Mulvey’s <em>Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema</em> ([1975] 1998) again. This text has sneaked around in my mind lately as I have been pondering about two matters of gazes in subject/object relations. One of them concerns the album that Kim Petras recently released <em>Slut Pop</em>, and the other relates to the concept of <em>ridiculization</em> that I have been thinking about defining for two years now. Actually, the concept of <em>ridiculization</em> was sown in my brain exactly two years ago, when I wrote <a href="https://monstromusi.com/2020/02/21/in-the-search-for-acknowledgement-of-queer-metal-identities/">“In the Search for Acknowledgement of Queer Metal Identities”</a>.</p>



<p>Shortly before the release of the album, a fan tweets: “Kim petras went from not showing herself on the covers to fully owning her sexuality as a trans woman I am proud of this woman you don’t understand” (@Celebirteas 2022). Petras is very explicitly (self)sexualized on all of the songs of <em>Slut Pop</em> and even though many fans appreciate her sex-empowering (Milton 2022), it is hard for me to judge the album as empowering without further ado. The discussion of the album peeks into a much larger debate among feminist scholars about when sexualization of women subordinates women and when does it empower women. I am usually more interested in conclusions that point towards empowerment when those are adequate, but I am (personally) concerned with the consequences of this music. I fear that this album might encourage further fetishization of transgender women, which is already a structural problem concerning equal rights for transgender people. However, I am also aware that this fear can make me blind to empowering potentials. I hope a close reading of Mulvey’s <em>Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema</em> can help me a step further in my judgement of the album.</p>



<p>The other matter of which Mulvey’s concept of <em>the male gaze</em> could be interesting is my speculations on ridiculization. I like to think of ridiculization as a translation of <em>sexualization</em> from a language of pleasure to a language of laughter. Both concepts are acts objectifying people through alienation. Both kinds of objectification force a person out from the realm of <em>people</em> by ignoring their worth, integrity, and dignity until they are reduced to their apparent value of sexual appeal or fun.</p>



<p>Now I have spent enough time writing down thoughts about why Mulvey’s chapter might be interesting. Now, I better get to read it. I will write a blog post about what I have figured out soon if I have time.</p>
