<h2>Sometimes, Writing Feels Like Killing Flowers</h2>

<p>I have lost something, but I can’t quite say what it is; so, it will be hard to find. It is a bit like when I have lost my glasses and I can’t find my glasses because I have lost my glasses. Maybe this could be a clue? That what I have lost is something that helps me say things. It definitely is. It feels like what I have lost is some kind of spark, or light or some kind of inspiration. Right now, it feels like when I put words on the page, the words die and the text dries out; like when we pick green leaves from a plant; then it won’t take long before they have come all brown, and they become so fragile that if we touch them, our touch eradicates them into dust. This is how my language feels to me right now; like killing flowers. It sounds pathetic; it sounds like I’m pretending to be an <em>artsy</em> poet. I hate artsy. To me, artsy is a kitch aesthetic that has managed to find a few codes that resemble art but without having anything to communicate except looking like art.</p>



<p>But I don’t pretend to be a poet. I just attempt to put how I feel into words. It stresses me that my language doesn’t work. Fortunately, I have some time before the writing part of my project on ridiculization begins. Yesterday, I wrote a blog post trying to put some concerns about the project on paper, but I really don’t know if they made sense, and while writing, I kinda figured out a solution, but the solution is far beyond the scope of the project of 12-15 pages. But that’s part of the magic of writing; writing about the problem sometimes serve solutions to the problem. Like right now. Writing this blog post might not have helped me make my writing less dry, but it helped me realize that my yesterday post served its purpose, which was not to make pretty or monstrous text but to help me get around my concerns. But I must admit, I miss writing something on monsters. I should have thought more about monsters this semester. I don’t know how I could neglect the monster; the monster is like my child.</p>
