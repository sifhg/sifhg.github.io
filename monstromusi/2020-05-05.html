<h2>Review of “The Weird and the Eerie” by Mark Fisher</h2>

<p>The central aim of Mark Fisher’s book <em>The Weird and the Eerie</em> (2016) is to define the terms ‘the weird’ and ‘the eerie.’ He bases these terms on his reading of Freud’s essay <em>The Uncanny</em> ([1919] 2003) on the aesthetics of <em>unheimlich</em>. Fisher insists on leaving ‘unheimlich’ untranslated because it “has been inadequately translated into English as the ‘uncanny’; the word which better captures Freud’s sense of the term is the ‘unhomely’.” (Fisher 2016, Introduction). By deriving the <em>weird</em> and the <em>eerie</em> from the Freudian ‘unheimlich,’ Fisher follows a tradition of bringing the terminology of psychoanalysis into the analysis of the arts. He then uncovers what he finds out about the art and the individual to make conclusions about the relationship between cultural texts and their surrounding society. He establishes the two terms by exemplifying their usages in a diverse and seemingly incoherent body of cultural texts “ranging from literary classics to 1980s post-punk-rock albums” (Hassler-Forrest 2017, 403). This diverse body of cases shows the political potential of the terms and positions the book within the studies of horror and science fiction in Western popular culture.</p>



<p>Fisher joins a discussion among genre critics on the <em>weird</em> by delivering his take on it as “that <em>which does not belong</em>.” (Fisher 2016, Introduction). After 40 pages of elaboration on the<em> weird</em>, Fisher spends about 100 pages on establishing his most significant addition to the debate: the <em>eerie</em>. The <em>eerie</em> is a term describing an unsettling emptiness in landscapes and abandoned places (Luckhurst 2017). It is an affect related to the concern of existence and non-existence that is evoked by questions like “<em>Why is there something when there should be nothing? Why is there nothing here when there should be something?</em>” (Fisher 2016, Introduction). The <em>weird</em> is a mode that “involves a sensation of wrongness” (Fisher 2016, The Out of Place and the Out of Time); it is the experience of something that does not belong and something familiar that are brought together. The<em> eerie</em>, unlike the<em> weird</em>, rarely manifests as familiar objects and spaces. Instead, “we find the eerie more readily in landscapes partially emptied of the human” (Fisher 2016, Introduction).</p>



<p>Fisher proposes this terminology of <em>weird</em> and <em>eerie</em> to integrate his “post-Lacanian, post- Žižekian Marxism” of political and philosophical views on the study of cultural texts (Luckhurst 2017). Fisher’s terminology can nuance, how we understand experiences of being confronted with <em>othered</em> individuals. An example of this is the exploration of Fisher’s terminology by the classically trained flutist Hannah Reardon-Smith (2019). She uses Fisher’s terminology to analyze how improvising female musicians appear <em>weird </em>within a normativity that considers improvisation as a masculine practice. The book helps the reader identify structural disturbances (Woodard 2017, 1181) by investigating “[…] that which lies beyond standard perception, cognition and experiences” (Fisher 2016, Introduction).</p>



<p>There is something <em>eerie</em> about how Fisher uses the word ‘to haunt’ in this book. Seven years before the publishing of <em>The Weird and the Eerie</em>,<em> </em>he explored the verb “to haunt” as a concept in his article <em>What is Hauntology?</em> (2012). Although he uses the word in this book, he only refers to his article transtextually: never formally. He refrains from letting the reader know what he means; he purposely does not even hint that it is a term by putting it in italics. He uses the word when talking about the texts, he analyses: “[…] but by the end of the project we found that much of the music, film and fiction that had always haunted us possessed the quality of the eerie.” (Fisher 2016, Introduction). This evokes the <em>eerie</em> because he is hiding something in the text; one can only wonder if there are other hidden terms.</p>
