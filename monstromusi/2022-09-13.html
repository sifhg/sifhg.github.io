<h2>My Queer Utopia</h2>

<p>I have been thinking about a Queer utopia for quite some time, and now my urge to build it has grown so much that I must start. My utopia is a district where Queers can live free from gender-normative matrices in all aspects of everyday life: a place where Queers can walk through the public sphere, the private sphere, and the professional sphere without feeling like a stranger anywhere.</p>



<p>When I give air to my vision of a Queer district, more than one person has asked me: “So you want to start gay bars?” Well, yes but actually, not really. My vision is not about very specific businesses but about a city structure where subversive businesses and institutions flourish and thrive. As a part of the recreational aspect (the public sphere), there should be gay bars in the sense that there should be bars where Queers feel safe, feel welcome, feel normal, and feel part of a community. I will not get too concrete on how to ensure bars with such an atmosphere in this blog post, but there are plenty of examples to learn from when it is time to make gay bars, and the structure should encourage more diverse Queer spaces of recreation than those that pop culture has already hardcoded as Queer. My utopia should cater to the diversity of the minorities; there should be coffee shops, restaurants, sports and games, wellness, book clubs and discussion groups, workshop groups and classes, cooking classes and poetry slams, music venues, fashion houses and more. The recreational spaces do not have to be full of rainbows – a lot of Queers aren’t even that fond of rainbows actually – but they should all have an atmosphere of safe spaces.</p>



<p>Another aspect that might seem peculiar to a Queer city, but is essential to a proper utopia, is housing. One area to safen spaces is in the recreational areas; another is where people have their homes. I imagine a housing association where only members and employees of the businesses under my utopia can get their names on the waiting list. People that do not subscribe to the idea of normalization and equal rights for Queers would never find themselves as employees or customers of businesses with those values. Therefore, the housing association would not need to enact difficult rules of exclusion to prevent unpleasant people, as enrolment would never get relevant. A democratic living area with diverse people of shared values should organically evolve into a pleasant vicinity for the dwellers without central forces from the main organization having to intervene.</p>



<p>The dwellings should meet a variety of Queer needs of living circumstances:</p>



<ul>
<li>collective dwellings with easy access to household features for groups of elders to live together,</li>



<li>dwellings with enough room for families with children and more than two parents,</li>



<li>dorms for students,</li>



<li>and distributions of rooms for chosen families and polycules.</li>
</ul>



<p>This is an inexhaustible list, and I should team up with the right expert to make the best architectural circumstances for my dwellers.</p>



<p>I also want to secure a future for the inhabitants. I want creative schools that can teach children of the area to express themselves beyond the capacities of the schools that are structured by political governments. With a future army of young people from the same vicinity that create art, music and literature from the Queers, an atmosphere of this particular district will emerge, and historians will manifest the district in the collective minds of the future: not just as an idea, but as a sense of a Queer people. These artists will be symbol creators, deliver identity markers, strengthen the voices of the inhabitants, and unify a people of diversity.</p>
