<h2>About me</h2>

<p>My name is Sif Høg and this is my blog, Monstromusi. I am a monster explorer and a musicologist trained at University of Copenhagen.</p>



<p>On this blog, you can follow my academic journey towards a musicology of <em>monsters</em>. I write about my studies that concentrate on key topics of this (yet) undefined field. This includes gender studies, metal studies, Japanese popular culture (especially the study of <em>visual kei</em>), aesthetic studies, music sociology, and philosophy of popular culture.</p>



<p>The name “Monstromusi” is derived from <em>monster</em> and <em>music</em>. However, I omitted the letter “c” in music because I thought it would sound cuter this way.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Subversive Potential of Monsters</h4>



<p>Since I wrote my bachelor thesis in the spring of 2019, I have been fascinated with monsters. In my field notes about a concert in Yokohama with the <em>visual kei</em> band Diaura I wrote:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify" style="margin-left:40px;"><font size="3">The performance of Yo-ka was aggressive in a manner that made it difficult to call it feminine. However, it was neither masculine. He was bestial. The aggression wasn’t a masculine expression. I wonder if bestiality can be considered as something intensifying one’s gender. In that case, he wasn’t genderless, rather the complete opposite: a multi-gendered monster. A human body holding so much more than a human that ‘he’ becomes a superhuman sex-monster. Admired by hundreds of concertgoers this night. Having a gender is human, and because ‘he’ has gendered qualities transcending the limits of any single gender, ‘he’ is more of a person than any single-gendered human is. Like a monster, ‘his’ gendered being recklessly transcends the normative laws of gender. However, among ‘his’ fans, ‘he’ is the most completed person. ‘He’ can do everything because ‘he’ isn’t limited by norms. The ultimate lover. ‘His’ fans gave themselves up to ‘him’ by letting ‘his’ music dictate them. Sometimes ‘he’ posed sensually like a front-page model for a women’s magazine; sometimes ‘he’ swung around on the stage like a badly behaved monkey.</font></p>



<p>That night, I saw a musical monster up close for the first time, and I realized the subversive potential of monstrous performativity. Then I began looking into earlier studies of monsters: firstly “A Cyborg Manifesto” by the biologist and gender theorist Donna Haraway ([1984] 2016) and then a transcription of a lecture by the historian and philosopher Michel Foucault on how those in power have dealt with monsters through history ([1999] 2003).</p>



<p>The <em>cyborg</em> is a specific kind of monsters that confronts and deconstructs normativities that cannot accept multi-gendered bodies; though Yo-ka differs from the mechanical-biological cyborg, <em>his</em> multi-gendered bestiality can attack normativities in a similar fashion. This realization gave me an urge to look further into the studies of monsters.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">I have chosen to pick up on the more general definition of <em>the monster</em> by Foucault:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify" style="margin-left:40px;"><font size="3">[… What] defines the monster is the fact that its existence and form is not only a violation of the laws of society but also a violation of the laws of nature. Its very existence is a breach of the law at both levels. […] The monster is the limit, both the point at which law is overturned and the exception that is found only in extreme cases. The monster combines the impossible and the forbidden.</font><br><font size="3"></font></p><p align="right"><font size="3">(Foucault, [1999] 2003, 55-6) </font></p>



<p>In this sense, monsters are rare beings and therefore difficult to study. I must look for any traces they might have left. My goal now is to understand the musical monsters, so that we can better fight evil.</p>
