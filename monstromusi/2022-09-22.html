<h2>Why Glasgow?</h2>

<p>When I went on a journey to Andalusia – as many transfemmes tend to do – I met a handful of Queers of different ages and from all over the world. I asked one where she came from and when she told me that she was from England, another Queer who also happened to be English said, “I’m sorry to hear that”.</p>



<p>In my latest blog post, <a href="https://monstromusi.com/https:/monstromusi.com/2022/09/13/my-queer-utopia/09/13/my-queer-utopia/">“My Queer Utopia”</a>, I introduced my dream about a Queer utopia that I want to build. Specifically, I imagine a district in Glasgow: Scotland’s most populous city. “Why Glasgow?” people often ask, when I present this project; Glasgow seems like such a peculiar place to dream about for a young, Danish student like me with few connections to the UK.</p>



<p>I see a special potential in Glasgow because of the Queer rights situation in the UK in general. The “I’m sorry to hear that”-comment I heard in Andalusia was not just a pouty response from one dissatisfied Queer/British lady but a reflection of the UK’s general reputation among Queers as <em>TERF Island</em>. The UK has a reputation for an anti-trans culture, globally articulated in tweets and fiction by J.K. Rowling, and a lack of Queer rights. Last year, the UK minister of equality and women, Liz Truss (now prime minister), distanced LGBTQ+ people from the government by withdrawing 250 government departments and public bodies from the Stonewall Diversity Champions programme: a program that is supposed to secure diversity in the workplace and prevent exclusion of LGBTQ+ people in recruitment (Maurice 2021). Another political arena where British Queers experience resistance is when it comes to transition-related healthcare that is structurally difficult to access (ILGA 2022, United Kingdom: health). These circumstances are also reflected in civil attitudes that cause young Queers to fear rejection from their families, which is the most common reason for homelessness in the UK (ILGA 2022, United Kingdom: housing).</p>



<p>While these circumstances cause many Queers to dissociate from England, where the anti-Queer tendencies of the UK are the most apparent, Scotland has her own national government and parliament, Holyrood, that is more prone to take progressive action. More auspiciously than Westminster, all parties in the Scottish parliament have promised to ban conversion therapy (ILGA 2022, United Kingdom: bodily integrity), and in March 2021 Holyrood passed a law against hate crimes, “which covers LGBTI people as protected groups and strengthens protections” (ILGA 2022, United Kingdom: bias-motivated violence).</p>



<p>To answer the question “why Glasgow?”, Glasgow is an easily accessible city to English Queers, who do not find themselves comfortable in their home country, and who might find the Scottish political landscape more attractive as it seems to be more protective. Holyrood’s contrast to the anti-Queer policies of the Conservative Party manifests hope. I want to build a lighthouse of a utopia in Glasgow to make a hospitable space for English/Queer civil rights refugees to feel safe, normal, and part of a community.</p>
