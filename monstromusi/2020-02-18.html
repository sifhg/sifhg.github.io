<h2>The Influence that Dance has on Music</h2>

<p>Today I got an overview of the second book that my supervisor (the choreomusicologist Inger Damsholt) recommended me. This book is called “Bodies of Sound” and is written by the dance scholar Sherril Dodds and the feminist musicologist Susan Cook, who studies concerts (2016). I should look into the research of Cook as I might want to write my MA thesis next year on <em>monstrous</em> performances at big live concerts as a socio-musicological <em>queer</em> phenomenon. The book investigates cases where it is necessary to look into dance phenomena in order to understand the musical phenomena (Dodds and Cook 2016, 1). Dance constitutes a context on which the meaning of the music depends. The interpretations of music always depends on its context, so a study on music can usually suggest a further study, where one looks into more contextual parameters. An analogy to this is <em>thick description</em> that is developed by the anthropologist Clifford Geertz (1975): a type of description of humans’ behaviors concerning symbols that takes observations of the contexts into account so that anthropologists as outsiders can better understand the meaning of the symbol. One can never ‘truly’ understand music without also analyzing its context, just as one can never ‘truly’ understand the meaning of song lyrics without also analyzing the sound of the music.</p>



<p>Dodds and Cook delivers an array of cases with various functions of the dance-music synthesis in (so-called) popular culture, e.g. enacting social identities, and the reconstruction of folk music by the band Bellowhead (Dodds 2016, 4).</p>



<p>My immediate thought on this book is that it doesn’t deliver much theoretical material for understanding the dance-music synthesis but it can contextualize the existing theory in the domain of popular culture.</p>
