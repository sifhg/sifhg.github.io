<h2>Back in the Saddle</h2>

<p>The past half-year has been a turbulent period for me, and the sudden decline in blog posts I have published since June reflects this. A loved one died (<em>your music will live on for many years, I promise</em>), I became a political representative for 8,500 university students during a global pandemic, and now, I stand in front of a thrilling – yet frightening – personal adventure. I love academic projects but all these circumstances have made that very hard for me. I am out of my academic routine and now it is time to get back in the saddle. I am excited to focus more on the academic routine again, but I expect it to be hard to catch up.</p>



<p>I need to get started very structurally, to get back in the routine. I have previously experienced that reading about how to study effectively has helped me get started and eventually reignited my motivation to write. My next task is to sketch and concretize my upcoming study of Malice Mizer’s song Illuminati (Malice Mizer [1998] 2002). The first thing I need for that is a comprehensive view of the relevant literature on queer theory, performance analysis, and biographical literature on the band. So to get started, I read the short paper “How to Read a Paper” by Srinivasan Keshav (2011) that suggests a&nbsp;<em>three-pass approach</em>. By splitting the reading into three passes, the reader first gets a very broad overview of the content and usage of a paper, and ends with an understanding of the paper that is so detailed that the reader should be “able to reconstruct the entire structure of the paper from memory, as well as be able to identify its strong and weak points” (Keshav 2011). To sketch my project on Malice Mizer, I will settle for the first pass that “prevents me from drowning in the details” (Keshav 2011) while I gather enough comprehension to decide what literature I will need.</p>
