<h2>A Metal Friendship of a Gay Man and Kawaii Girls</h2>

<p>Since my first blog post <a href="https://monstromusi.com/2020/02/16/the-start-of-a-year-of-choreomusicology/">“The Start of a Year of Choreomusicology”</a>, I have been looking for a case for my next project. Now, I have found this performance where Babymetal and Rob Halford perform three songs together. I am immediately excited about this case because it allows me to touch two topics that I am deeply engaged in ─ queer theory and metal studies ─ and merge them. It also gives me an opportunity to look into two new fields that I find very interesting as well: dance studies and the study of <em>cuteness</em>. In this performance, the homosexual heavy metal singer Rob Halford from the band Judas priest performs three songs with the <em>kawaii metal</em> band Babymetal: “Karate” by Babymetal, “Painkiller” and “Breaking the Law” by Judas Priest.</p>

<p>Each of these songs represents the performers’ styles respectively. In this performance, the songs carry general references to conceptual ideas of the performers, rather than general meanings of the songs that one can get from purely lyrical and music-theoretical analyses. This allows me to neglect careful investigation of song-specific meanings and instead examine the performance as a whole narrative of queer social interactions between a gay masculinity and&nbsp;<em>kawaii</em>&nbsp;femininity. By analyzing this performance as a queer social interaction between a gay man and cute girls, I hope to deliver some profound knowledge of non-erotic and non-romantic yet queer friendships.</p>
