<h2>Thoughts on the Dance Space</h2>

<p>On my first blog post <a href="https://monstromusi.com/2020/02/16/the-start-of-a-year-of-choreomusicology/">“The Start of a Year of Choreomusicology”</a>, I introduced my idea about <em>the dance space</em> as a concept. I derive this idea of the dance space from the concept <em>the sonic space</em> that the metal anthropologist Amber Clifford-Napoleone uses in her book “Queerness in Heavy Metal Music” to explore the <em>queerscape</em>. The purpose of a study on the dance space would be to explore the queerscape further. When defining the queerscape, Clifford-Napoleone refers to a conference paper called <em>Mapping the Shifting Queerscape</em> by the environmental planner Gordon Brent Ingram. I should present a definition of queerscape in a later blog post.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sonic Space</h4>



<p>Clifford-Napoleone talks about musical performances as something that performers express through multiple channels simultaneously; one of those channels is the sonic space. She describes <em>the sonic space</em> as a channel through which performers can dispatch queer messages, so the message is only delivered to those capable of understanding the specific sonic language that the performers use. This allows queer communication to bypass barriers and access rooms where queers are normally prohibited from speaking up because of suppression from <em>the heterosexual matrix</em>. The sonic space hides queer massages, and it gives musicians the ability to communicate different messages to different parts of the crowd simultaneously. One crowd of both heteronormative and queer fans can go to the same concerts and hear the same sound and appreciate the music differently because some messages are hidden in a space only accessible to queer fans.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">My Project on the Dance Space</h4>



<p>Inspired by Clifford-Napoleone’s sonic space, I would define <em>the dance space</em> as a channel for communicating musical performances. This space is a channel for communicating visual-bodily messages from the stage to the crowd alongside other visual spaces as well as the sonic and the lyrical space. I do not expect the dance space to be an alternative to the sonic space that allows musicians to communicate messages that are hidden to the heteronormative crowd; actually, I expect it to be a much more confronting<em> </em>space because of its explicitly graphic nature (unless it is also blurred by a veil of metaphors). The purpose of the dance space is to set a frame for how the crowd will interpret the remaining communication of the music. E.g. the music video for <em>I Want to Break Free</em> by Queen: the costumes and the choreographies set a frame for the lyrics to be interpreted as a song about acknowledging one’s bisexuality.</p>

<p>I believe the dance space gives the performers the ability to shape the interpretations of the crowd so that the same song can mean different things when accompanied by different choreographies. A purely lyrical view of the <em>I Want to Break Free</em> does not necessarily reveal any queer message. It is the costumes and choreographies in the music video that clearly tell us that the word <em>lies</em> in the line “I want to break free from your lies” refers to a pretending to be “normal” (read: <em>heterosexual</em>).</p>



<p>As a case for this project, I would like to analyze a heavy metal stadium concert; maybe there is something relevant from Judas Priest (who also comes to Copenhell this year, so I could use that as supplementary fieldwork). However, I would rather like to look into visual kei again. The problem with studying visual kei for me is that my Japanese is still not good enough. I should be able to understand everything the performers say and sing on stage ─ I should even be able to catch metaphorical references to other Japanese cultural phenomena ─ so that I know if something is only going through the dance space<em>,</em> or if it also goes through a linguistic space. On the other hand, what I find most interesting about visual kei and dance is the synchronized <em>social dancing</em> in the crowd that is a shared reaction to the present musical elements; visual kei fans call this <em>furitsuke</em> (振り付け). On the blog post <a href="http://macchalatte.blogspot.com/2013/03/furitsuke.html">“Furitsuke”</a>, a student of Japanese Studies using the pseudonym Gizorz explains the concept further.</p>
