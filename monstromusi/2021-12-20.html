<h2>Balancing Theory and Analysis Material</h2>

<p>When I write an academic text, I often realize that I might have two kinds of interested readers: those who are interested in the concrete subject that I analyze (in my current study, that is Lady Gaga, Kim Larsen, and Pussy Riot), and those who are interested in my conclusions about the abstract theory (which in my current study is about the social relationship between performing live musicians and their audiences). No matter the interests of the reader, they will learn about the musicians that I write about as well as my theoretical view on musical personages. In this duality between the concrete and the abstract, I usually have two intertwined conclusions: one conclusion about the wisdom of the musician’s art that we can learn from as humans, and one that I hope will add knowledge to the theoretical framework that <em>we</em> can learn from as academics (<em>we</em> in italics because I acknowledge that we are not all academics).</p>



<p>As I write, I often struggle with satisfying both the need to keep my thoughts on the paper concrete while also supporting the abstract conclusions (both those about the wisdom of the art and those about academic theory), as they often require a lot of abstract thoughts to support them.</p>



<p>I think it is a healthy sign of trustworthiness when the abstract thoughts that are supposed to support the conclusive statements are connected to something concrete. Frequent connections between abstract thoughts and concrete material assure both my reader and me that the text actually is about something real and not just noise in a discourse of fancy words. I consider it a question about writing skills to formulate abstract ideas using concrete material. It is very ironic how this very blog post already has lured itself into almost purely abstract statements at this point.</p>



<p>I recently came across an abstract of a chapter written by the queer theorist Jack Halberstam that very neatly maintains both the presence of the concrete material of his analysis and his abstract thesis:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify" style="margin-left:40px;"><font size="3">This chapter uses two eccentric musical examples from Black cultural history in order to trace the kind of gender variance that peppers popular culture on the one hand and racial formations on the other. By writing about Big Mama Thornton and Sylvester, furthermore, I forge an alternative genealogy of music by linking two performers not in terms of genre or period but in terms of the vocal innovations that attend their queerly gendered performances. I present each case separately and then conclude with some thoughts about how to create a history of “musical genders.”

<p>This abstract consists of three sentences that each manages to incorporate both the concrete material and the abstract thoughts, and each of them manage to fulfil one of three classic functions of introductions in academic disciplines: establishing a research territory, establishing a niche, and occupying the niche (Swales and Feak 2012, 368).</p>



<p>Let me try to break each sentence down to make a generalized structure that can be used for many other studies on other topics as well.</p>



<p>Sentence structure 1: “This chapter uses” + <em>generalized material</em> + “in order to” + <em>the route to the conclusion</em>.</p>



<p>The first sentence structure informs the reader what field the study concerns.</p>



<p>Sentence structure 2: “By writing about” + <em>concrete material</em> + “I forge an alternative” + <em>theory suggested</em>.</p>



<p>The second sentence structure informs the reader about the niche, specific to the study and suggests a gap in the current research.</p>



<p>Sentence structure 3: “I present each case separately and” + <em>following structure</em>.</p>



<p>The third sentence structure occupies the niche by indicating a structure and outlining the purpose of the study. These sentence structures fulfil at least the bare minimum of what is required for an introduction while they constantly keep the abstract ideas connected to the concrete material that the study concerns. I think this is neat and I will probably borrow this structure for my current study.</p>
