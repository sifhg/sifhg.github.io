<h2>Thoughts on Disciplinary Writing in the (De)constructivist Gender Studies of Arts</h2>

<p>I often write within a discipline of (de)constructivist gender studies. Many (de)constructivists favor deconstructivist practices: both as subjects of studies and as academic practices. The queer theorist Jack Halberstam explains the unconventional style of his book “The Queer Art of Failure.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify" style="margin-left:40px;"><font size="3">This book […] must make a long detour around disciplines and ordinary ways of thinking.[…] Disciplinarity, as defined by Foucault (1995), is a technique of modern power: it depends upon [… conventions and produces] administrative forms of governance. The university structure [… can choose] between the university as corporation and investment opportunity and the university as a new kind of public sphere with a different investment in knowledge […]</font><br><font size="3"></font></p><p align="right"><font size="3">(Halberstam 2011, 7-8) </font></p>



<p>Referring to Foucault, he criticizes conventions for preventing new ideas from evolving. This has evolved a convention of breaking conventions. Supervisors have encouraged me to break academic conventions, when I estimate that it will benefit my project. They have used the argument that not everything is best described using a fixed set of conventions of form and style in an academic text. I experience that conventions help me think in a certain way that has been proven to be sufficient for certain tasks. I believe this can be a problem because sometimes the task is best solved with a structure different from the conventions.</p>



<p>The professor of film and media studies Caetlin Benson-Allott breaks conventions in her chapter “Going Gaga for Glitch” in a way that I would like to question.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify" style="margin-left:40px;"><font size="3">During such glitches, the medium becomes a temporal presence, a missed beat or ———— outside the hermetic order of the code. Dropped frames (and, less often, missing measures) interrupt choreography, <strike>visual pleasure</strike>, and the viewer’s fantasy of mastery.</font><br><font size="3"></font></p><p align="right"><font size="3">(Benson-Allott 2013, 127) </font></p>



<p>The chapter contains regular crossed out words, binary code and unusual characters. She projects the glitches that she examines onto her writing style. As a reader, I experience this projection at the expense of clarity and her authority as an academic. Because of the clarity issues, I am careful about writing in such a creative style. I am less skeptical about the disappearance of authority because I believe academic authority in writing is mostly an emotional reflection of how well the text resembles other texts within the same discipline. If authority is a reflection of resemblance, it is an emotional mechanism that conserves academic traditions within the system that Halberstam criticizes in the quote.</p>
