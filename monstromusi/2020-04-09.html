<h2>Academic Writing is Almost Science Fiction</h2>

<p>During my teenage years, I dreamt about becoming a science fiction author. I strove to evoke feelings of (so-called) awesomeness that we know from popular culture and simultaneously deliver profound views on life. I won’t claim that I ever managed to deliver a profound view on anything though. To ensure that my stories would be catchy reading, I mapped out ‘awesome’ scenarios for the plot without thinking much about how they would fit together; then I could put them in order, give them value relating to my message, alter them and maybe even discard half of them.</p>



<p>Though this approach would not work for academic writing, where the text has to be unambiguous, it is my foundation for how I write academic texts. Firstly, I write down all the headings that I think are important. Then I write down a lot of pseudo-text under each heading; doing this, I only care about creating something that will remind me what I want in my final text, not about coherence, grammar nor spelling. I write down everything that I think is important or interesting, and I do this as quickly as possible so my mind won&#8217;t have much time to forget one point while I write another one down. I’m racing a force of forgetfulness while filling blank spaces. After this comes a much slower process, where I spend hours tidying up the chaotic pseudo-text until it looks like an academic text.</p>



<p>The idea of writing pseudocode is inspired by a technique from programming, where the programmer writes ‘pseudocode’ before writing the actual code. <em>Pseudocode</em> is an abstraction of an algorithm that resembles computer code but is easier to understand for humans. It’s used by programmers to get a comprehensive view of the program they are about to <em>write</em> before they start writing complex computer codes.</p>



<p>I choose to publish this post after a conversation about academic writing with a good friend of mine, a student of comparative literature.&nbsp;</p>
