<h2>The Wandering Socialist Prince</h2>

<p>Yesterday evening, I went to an almost empty film hall to watch the Chilean film <em>The Wandering Soap Opera</em> (Spanish: <em>La telenovela errante</em>) directed by Raúl Ruiz and Valeria Sarmiento (2017). I do not claim that I understood anything of it, but it certainly made an impression on me: a young, pretentious, Danish student of the arts who does not know much about the everyday life of the Chileans. Wandering through a flow of satirical situations that are set in the mundane Chile that parody the genre of soap opera itself, I <em>detoured</em> through the absurd lands of erotism, leftism and satire.</p>



<p>Particularly the opening scene made me think. It shows a senior man admiring the legs of a young woman. The woman asks which of her legs he likes the most; without a doubt, he replies “the left one.” <em>The left one</em> leads the dialogue to a discussion on his socialist ideology. The dialogue turning to socialism does not break the flirtatious temper; it rather seasons the temper with passion. If one understands that socialism is an ideology of passionate love, it is not hard to see the sensuality of its aesthetics. Passionate socialism expresses both tenderness and rejection in its fight for justice. Socialism is appealing to those who believe that <em>we</em> – the people – can achieve a better world through solidarity. It is because of this appeal that totalitarian regimes sometimes abuse the name of the ideology. The aesthetics of socialism is an assemblage of <em>community</em> and a <em>passionate will to progress</em>. This aesthetics can even accompany and intensify the sincerity of sexual desire in the heart of a proud socialist.</p>



<p>Thinking of socialism as aesthetics, I started wondering if any school of governance could be considered a form of aesthetics. What if the political leaders were artists? The population was the guests of the gallery? And the realization of a nation was a piece of art? What if Machiavelli’s&nbsp;<em>The Prince</em>&nbsp;was a guide to please the guests of the gallery aesthetically? Then, the border between political science and the study of the arts would blur; suddenly political theory would be seasoned with the&nbsp;<s>erotic</s>&nbsp;desire of aesthetic pleasure. What is the purpose of governing, if not to ensure the pleasure of the people?</p>
