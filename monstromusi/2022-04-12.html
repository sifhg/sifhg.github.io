<h2>Doubting the Strength of my Concept: Ridiculization</h2>

<p>I have touched on the idea of suggesting a concept of <em>ridiculization</em> or <em>ridiculous objectification</em> a couple of times here on Monstromusi already. The first time was two years ago when I explained one reason why it was important to study the Japanese metal scene <em>visual kei</em>. In that blog post, <a href="https://monstromusi.com/2022/02/21/gazes-sluts-and-ridiculizations/">“In the Search for Acknowledgement of Queer Metal Identities”</a>, I introduced ridiculous objectification in comparison to sexual objectification.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify" style="margin-left:40px;"><font size="3">When engaging in casual conversations about metal music […], one most often is surrounded by heteronormative discourses; those discourses can only allow men to appear&nbsp;feminine&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<em>non-masculine</em>), if these men are&nbsp;<em>othered&nbsp;</em>and made objects of ridicule, whereby their worths are reduced to their levels of fun and their personal dignities are erased. The nature of this kind of objectification shares some dynamics with&nbsp;<em>sexual&nbsp;</em>objectifications of&nbsp;<em>women</em>&nbsp;as both erase personal worth by means of the sexuality of the objectified individual.</font><br><font size="3"></font></p><p align="right"><font size="3">(Høg 2020)</font></p>



<p>I have to consider what cases of ridicule qualify as objectification, and what the basis is for comparing it to sexual objectification. First, I do not want to underestimate the experience and consequences of sexual objectification, so I have to make sure that when comparing the dynamics of the two I am also able to take into account the affective aspects of the objectified person. Can I just translate the concept of sexual objectification like this? In the former blog post, I proposed ridiculization as something that degrades a person utilizing that person’s sexuality. That made sense in the scope of that blog post explaining how I turned to visual kei to find an aesthetic legitimizing visual expression of queer identities without them being objects of ridicule. For this upcoming study, I consider two cases of radicalization:</p>



<ul><li>When Rob Halford performed with Babymetal at Alternative Press Music Awards in 2016, he got ridiculing comments on social media questioning his masculinity for performing with teenage girls and for being a gay man.</li><li>When Rebecca Black’s <em>Friday</em> was published in 2011, the song and the music video went viral. Comments on YouTube ridiculed Rebecca Black for being a bad singer and having written a song that was unofficially declared the worst song ever.</li></ul>



<p>In the case of Rebecca Black, the ridiculing comment are not very concerned with exhibiting her sexuality so does the dynamics from sexual objectification still apply to this situation? If so, I think I will have to broaden the perspective to concern the degradation of a person’s identity rather than specifically their sexuality.</p>
