<h2>I Got Writer&#8217;s Block… What a Cliché</h2>

<p>I have gotten writer’s block. It is a rather serious case actually. The symptoms have been present since July where I did not post anything. I started feeling better around Christmas and I even wrote a post about it on December 20, <a href="https://monstromusi.com/2020/12/20/back-in-the-saddle/">“Back in the Saddle,”</a> but I was too quick to report myself recovered.</p>



<p>According to Will Buckingham’s post <a href="https://medium.com/creators-hub/bad-diagnoses-whats-wrong-with-writer-s-block-d538a9e33696">“Bad Diagnoses: What’s Wrong With Writer’s Block,”</a> after acknowledging that I suffer from writer’s block, my next step to recovery is to specify the diagnosis. What blocks me from writing is that the writing tasks that I have given myself require more concentration than my brain can comprehend. I have a bunch of drafts lying around that all have the potential to become blog posts that I would proudly post here on Monstromusi. It is such a shame that they are only drafts because most of them relate more directly to monsters than many of my current posts. In most cases, what I need to turn my drafts into final blog posts is either to do some translations of Japanese lyrics or to read up on some academic literature. Well, now that I know what to do to get past the block: come let’s go, let’s translate some Japanese lyrics and read some awesome monster theory! Even though both things used to excite me, something within me holds me back.</p>



<p>Last summer, someone who was very close to me passed away and just recently I lost another one. So I am struggling with a lot of grief at the moment that has made it very difficult for me to focus. My life is completely different know and I spend a lot of energy getting used to my new reality. Things that used to excite me bores me now. This means that I cannot keep up my Japanese, and I only have a very limited attention span when I try to read, and it does not matter whether I read something because I have to or because I want to.</p>



<p>Now it is clear to me what blocks me from posting on the blog at the moment. So what do I do to recover? I do not know – grief takes its time – but being more clear about what is wrong calms my frustration about not posting as much as I would like to.</p>
